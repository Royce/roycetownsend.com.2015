# Royce Townsend is a generous and thoughtful person living in Perth, Australia.

Royce is a programmer.

When I am not programming (and am awake) I can be found swing dancing, rock-climbing, cycling, running, juggling, fire twirling, playing boardgames, enjoying music, drinking coffee, gardening, or reading a book.
