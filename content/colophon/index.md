This website is a bunch of html/javascript/css/images hosted on Amazon S3. It's a static website (no CMS).
Here's how I [generate and deploy the static site using Grunt](tutorial-making-static-website-with-grunt-and-assemble.html). The source code for the website is hosted on [GitHub](http://github.com/Royce/roycetownsend.com)

The resum√© is created using LaTex. Source code also on [GitHub](http://github.com/Royce/resume)
